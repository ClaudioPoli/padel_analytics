# Setup
1. Clone this repository.
2. Setup virtual environment.
```
conda create -n python=3.12 <yourenv> pip
conda activate <yourenv>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Install pytorch https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/.
4. Download weights.
In order to have access to the models' weights, please email me at jsilvawasd@hotmail.com describing your motivation and goals regarding this project. I am currenly trying to evolve to a point where this project is monetizable, as so, the access to the models' weights is limited to possible collaborations. I encourage you to train your own models and get this framework to the next level!
